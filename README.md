Matthew Dunbar - Data Analyst Portfolio

About
Hi, I'm Matt! I am finishing up a Master of Science degree from Central Washington University in Information Technology Management while specializing in Data Analytics. I also hold a Bachelors degree in Psychology w/ a minor degree in Economics.  

Since Covid, I have gained some work experience as a Data Collection Researcher/Machine Learning Data Associate at Amazon (1yr), where I was gathering CVML data for various Alexa services and devices such as Ring Cameras, Echo Show devices, and Astro the companion robot. As well, I worked as a User Research Assistant at Meta Reality Labs, Research (2yr) where I was able to be part of research studies being done for teams such as Eye Tracking Research, Display Systems Research, Applied Perceptual Science, as well as Augmented Reality Teams.


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
